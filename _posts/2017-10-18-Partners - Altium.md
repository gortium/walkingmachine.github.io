## Altium
Altium is known worldwide for their computer-aided design of 3D printed circuit boards (PCB).

Since 1985, Altium has been developing intuitive software to design PCBs. They are also developing Altium Vault which is an automated solution that manages design data and components directly into the design environment. It is designed specifically for the electronics industry.

Altium's electronic design tools are used by engineers in many industries, for example, aerospace and defense, life sciences, industrial automation controls and electronics and high technology.

Altium helps us in our project by offering us the licenses Altium Designer and Altium Vault. So we can develop our own electronic cards. This allows us to improve the electronic circuits of SARA from day to day and it is also what makes her unique!
